## Alert Manager
*   **Files**: `keep/api/routes/alerts.py`, `keep/api/core/alerts.py`.
*   **Responsibility**: CRUD operations for alerts, grouping logic, and history tracking.

## Workflow Engine
*   **Files**: `keep/workflowmanager`.
*   **Concepts**:
    *   **Step**: A single unit of work (e.g., "Send Slack Message").
    *   **Context**: Data passed between steps (available as `{{ steps.step_id.results }}`).
    *   **Providers**: The bridge to external tools.

## Providers System
*   **Factory Pattern**: `ProvidersFactory` dynamically loads providers based on configuration.
*   **BaseProvider**: All providers inherit from `BaseProvider`, ensuring a consistent interface (`notify`, `query`).
*   **Adding a Provider**: Create a new class in `keep/providers`, implement the standard methods, and register it.
